            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Nate Master. I'm an aspiring web developer who is transitioning to this field after nearly 15 years as a teacher and a coach. My passion for technology and programming is rooted in the numerous technology-oriented roles I held during my education career but also in my foundational belief that those who can adeptly utilize the newest technology set the direction for the whole world. My hobbies include being an avid sports fan, a foodie, a gamer, and a world-traveler with my wife, Meagan. I am always excited to explore new programming projects and love working collaboratively with others. Hopefully after examining some of my work, you believe we could collaborate in some way now or in the future.</p>
